General Template
================

FROM image				# Base Image. Always First Line in Docker File
ADD /my/Test.java /a/b/c/Test.java	# Adds files from your host into your host
RUN apt-get install java		# Runs any given command
ENV JAVA_HOME=/some/path		# Sets an env variable in the image
WORKDIR /a/b/c				# Sets a default working directory. If we ignore / is the working directory
EXPOSE	8050				# exposes a port for your application
ENTRYPOINT sleep 5			# Command to be executed once a container is created from this image

Hands On
========

Aim: Create a docker image which will show the date
===================================================

Pre-req: 
-------
a. Create a login id in hub.docker.com
b. alphine and busybox images should be downloaded
docker pull alpine
docker pull busybox  (Similar to ubuntu but only 1.2MB in size)

Step 1: Open Command Prompt and create a file name Dockerfile with no extn.
C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning>type nul>Dockerfile

Step 2: Open the file and type the following command. 
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT date

Step 3: Save the file and run the following command. 
Note: cmeatarun1988 is Arun's hub.docker.com userID. 
There is a dot at the end of the command. It tell you to create the image in the current working directory.

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker build -t=cmeatarun1988/datedisplay .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/2 : FROM alpine
 ---> 965ea09ff2eb
Step 2/2 : ENTRYPOINT date

SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. All files and directories added to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive files and directories.


Step 4: To check whether image is created or not?

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker images
REPOSITORY                  TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
cmeatarun1988/datedisplay   latest              ee1fdd610c1b        3 minutes ago       5.55MB
alpine                      latest              965ea09ff2eb        4 days ago          5.55MB
busybox                     latest              19485c79a9bb        7 weeks ago         1.22MB

Step 5: Run the custom image multiple times and check how many containers are created. 

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker run cmeatarun1988/datedisplay

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker run cmeatarun1988/datedisplay

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker run cmeatarun1988/datedisplay
Sat Oct 26 08:37:33 UTC 2019

C:\Users\janar\Desktop\DockerLearning\CustomImage>docker ps -a

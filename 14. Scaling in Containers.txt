SCALING in CONTAINERS
==========================================================

docker-compose ps
==> This gives the list of containers under docker-compose

docker-compose up -d
==> This command will not create new container but it will go and check what is the current state.

docker-compose up -d --scale chrome=4
==> This command will create 4 containers for chrome to support parallel threading mechanism.

You can add multiple instances with the below command. 
docker-compose up -d --scale chrome=4 --scale firefox=4


=======
Issue
=======
If you scale up and go to browser, number of instances increases in browser
HOwever, if you scale down, the browser refresh seems to hang. 

Reason: When you scale down, the node instance is deleted by the reference is not.
Node does not update hub about scaling down. 

Resolution: You need to wait for sometime for the hub to realize that the node is removed.
This process is automatic and needs no manual intervention.
